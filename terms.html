                            <p>Welcome to ENGLGO LTD, the premier service for people around the world to learn English.</p>
                            <h4>Subject and Structure of the Terms</h4>
                            <p>These subscription terms (the “Terms”) sets forth the terms for your purchase of a subscription to the ENGLGO LTD online language learning service (the “Subscription”). These Terms and the attached payment plan (the “Payment Plan”) define the business relationship between you and ENGLGO LTD 128 City Road, London, United Kingdom, EC1V 2NX (“ENGLGO LTD”) with respect to the Subscription for the use of the ENGLGO LTD online language learning service (“ENGLGO LTD”, the “Service” or the “Site”). In addition, you are bound by the Acceptable Use Policy on the Englishlive.com website.</p>
                            <p>By purchasing a gift subscription from, or subscribing to ENGLGO LTD, you agree, without qualification, to be bound by the Terms as set out below.</p>

                            <h4>Duration of the Subscription</h4>
                            <p>The term of your Subscription is as per the Payment Plan.</p>

                            <h4>Fees and Payment</h4>
                            <p>Some materials and features of the ENGLGO LTD Site are available only through the purchase of a Subscription. You are responsible for any charges associated with the connection to the Site. ENGLGO LTD reserves the right to change the subscription rates at any time or to set up new rates, upon notice posted on the Site and sent by email to its members in advance and, if applicable, communicate how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
                            <p>The purchase details of your current course are always available through the “Account Settings” section of the ENGLGO LTD Site and through the Payment Plan that you received when you purchased the course (including details on the payment plan and of the cancellation policy).</p>
                            <p>If your Subscription contains teacher-led classes, whether group or private, those sessions are delivered on a “use them or lose them basis”, this means that if you haven’t used those sessions by the end of your subscription, those unused sessions are lost to you and will not be refunded. If your paid subscription is a monthly recurring subscription, your teacher-led sessions will expire at the end of each month as described above.</p>

                            <h4>Trials</h4>
                            <p>From time to time, we may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). ENGLGO LTD may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
                            <p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL.</p>

                            <h4>Shared accounts</h4>
                            <p>There may be only one user associated with an account. Users may NOT share an account. Sharing your account with others may result in termination of your course.</p>

                            <h4>Cooling-off</h4>
                            <p>If you have purchased a Subscription online or via phone, you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the “Cooling-off Period”).</p>

                            <h4>Suspension</h4>
                            <p>You have a right to ask for a suspension of your course. Access to the course may be suspended for a minimum of seven (7) to a maximum of sixty (60) days. This operation can be requested several times during the Subscription period as long as the maximum total suspension period of sixty (60) days is not exceeded. During the pause, the payment plan is not going to change and the time the account is paused will be added to the end of the course.
                                You cannot suspend your course during the "cooling-off period" (if applicable).</p>

                            <h4>Renewal; Cancellation</h4>
                            <p>Unless your Subscription has been purchased for a fixed period, your payment to us will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. If you wish to cancel your subscription, you must inform us of your intent with at least 48 hours before your next month’s renewal date begins to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. If you cancel your Subscription after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), or before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. If you wish to receive a full refund of all monies paid to ENGLGO LTD before the Cooling-off Period is over, you must contact Customer Support. When we process any refund, we will refund amounts using the method you used for payment.</p>
                            <p>If you have purchased a subscription with a fixed duration and wish to cancel after the “Cooling-off Period”, you can do so within a maximum of 90 days from the start of the subscription (in this case the penalty of the administrative cost of 30% of the amount that remains to be paid for your course).</p>
                            <p>After 90 days of enrollment, no student can cancel the acquired contract and will be linked to the full payment of the plan in which they have enrolled. (ENGLGO LTD reserves the right to suspend all or part of the services provided to the Client in case of non-compliance with the Payment Plan, even temporarily, without prior notice)</p>
                            <p>If you wish to receive a full refund of the amount paid for a course to ENGLGO LTD live before the end of the “Cooling-off Period”, you must contact ENGLGO LTD Customer Service. The amounts will be refunded in the same payment method used at the time of purchase.</p>
